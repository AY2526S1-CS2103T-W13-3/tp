--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
Every feature in Atlas is designed around the real needs of F&B business owners ‚Äî where efficiency, organisation, and relationships matter most.
Each feature is represented by a command, allowing you to perform actions quickly and consistently.

Atlas‚Äô capabilities can be grouped into five key categories, each addressing a specific aspect of running your business:

1. ‚öôÔ∏è [General Commands](#general-commands):<br>
Handle your everyday essentials ‚Äî from viewing help guides to navigating the system ‚Äî so you can focus on operations, not admin work.


2. üë• [Contact Management Commands](#contact-management-commands):<br>
Keep track of your suppliers, customers, and stakeholders all in one place. Easily add, edit, or view contacts to maintain strong business relationships and never lose touch with key stakeholders.


3. üí≥ [Transaction Management Commands](#transaction-management-commands):<br>
Record, review, and update your orders and payments per contact, ensuring you always have a clear view of your financial exchanges ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs supplier invoices or customer payments.


4. üîî [Follow-Up Management Commands](#follow-up-management-commands):<br>
Stay on top of your commitments. Set and manage follow-ups with suppliers, customers or various stakeholders ‚Äî like confirming deliveries or payment dates ‚Äî so nothing slips through the cracks.


5. üì¶ [Data Management Commands](#data-management):<br>
Manage your data efficiently ‚Äî from saving backups to clearing outdated records ‚Äî keeping your system organised and your workflow smooth.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the attributes to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an attribute which can be used as `add n/John Doe`, `n/` is its attribute prefix.


* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/supplier` or as `n/John Doe`.


* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/supplier`, `t/supplier t/utility` etc.


* Attributes can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* Extraneous attributes for commands that do not take in attributes (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.


* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
